## React <a id="react"></a>

### Getting started with React <a id="getting-started-with-react"></a>

* ​[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)​

Creating web applications is hard work and like all good programmers we're going to be lazy. `create-react-app` does exactly that! It creates a React application without needing to install or configure tools like `Webpack` or `Babel`. They are hidden away, all set up with preconfigurations so we can focus on the code.

The first thing we need to do is install it globally.

`npm install -g create-react-app`

Once installed you can run the below code with the argument of your applications name. This will create the foundations of the application and store it in a folder with the same name as your application.

`create-react-app your_app_name_here`

`cd` into your applications directory and run `cat package.json` to show all the dependencies it has created for you.

```javascript
{
  "name": "intro",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.2.0",
    "react-dom": "^16.2.0",
    "react-scripts": "1.0.17"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test --env=jsdom",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject"
  }
}
```

### ReactJS - Components <a id="reactjs-components"></a>

Components are the building blocks of React. In a way they're pretty similar to Rails partials.

Components are basically functions that return HTML necessary to render a piece of the page. [Tyler McGiniss](https://twitter.com/tylermcginnis33) thinks of them as "[Kolaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolach)", because 'they have everything you need, wrapped in a delicious composable bundle."

Components:

* Can be written in either pure JavaScript or JSX
* Can only return a single element \(but that element can have multiple children\)
* Can either receive data from its parent component, or from the component itself
* Should pass the **FIRST** test, and be:
  * **Focused**
  * **Independent**
  * **Reusable**
  * **Small**
  * **Testable**

## Anatomy of a component <a id="anatomy-of-a-component"></a>

Here is an example of a simple component:

```javascript
// Import any modules required - at a minimum, we will need React, and (usually) ReactDOM.
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
​
// Create a new class that extends the React.Component
class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  // The only thing your component absolutely needs is a render function that returns HTML.
  render() {
    return (
      <div>Hello World</div>
    );
  }
}
​
// The ReactDOM.render function takes two arguments - what we want to render, and where we want to render it
ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloWorld />,                 // Invoke the component we want to render.
  document.getElementById("app")  // Where we want to render the component.
);
```

### Properties \(`props`\) <a id="properties-props"></a>

Component `props` are a great way to pass variables between components.

Let's make this a bit more dynamic by passing `props` from the `HelloWorld` component to a new `HelloUser` component, and using JSX to interpolate the variables \(encapsulated in curly brackets, eg `{this.props.name}`\).

In this context, `HelloWorld` is the **parent component**, which is **invoking** `HelloUser` - a **child component**.

```javascript
// We can also require 'Component' so we don't have to refer to it through `React.Component`. The cool kids are using PureComponent so we will require that instead. This will stop you from building bad habits later on.
import React, { PureComponent } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
​
class HelloUser extends PureComponent {
  render() {
    return (
      // The HelloWorld component that invokes HelloUser passed a name attribute, which can be accessed via this.props.name
      <p> Hello {this.props.name} </p>
    );
  }
}
​
class HelloWorld extends PureComponent {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
        <hr/>
        // Invoke the component we want to render - HelloUser - and pass in a 'name' attribute that can be accessed in the HelloUser component via this.props.name
        <HelloUser name="Groucho" />
        <HelloUser name="Chico" />
        <HelloUser name="Gummo" />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
​
ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloWorld />,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

#### `this.props.children` <a id="this-props-children"></a>

One useful component prop is `this.props.children` - this will give you the content of the component. If we have nested components, `this.props.children` will return an array of components nested within the parent component.

#### `prop` _types and validation_ <a id="prop-types-and-validation"></a>

To ensure our components are being used correctly, we can add validators to our component.

```javascript
class HelloUser extends PureComponent {
  render() {
    return (
      <p> Hello, {this.props.name} </p>
      <p> You are visitor number {this.props.visitor} to this site </p>
    );
  }
}
​
HelloUser.propTypes = {
  // Guarantee that our name prop is a string and is always present.
  name: React.PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  // Guarantee that our visitor prop is a number.
  visitor: React.PropTypes.number
};
```

#### _Default props_ <a id="default-props"></a>

We can also define default values for a component's props:

```javascript
class HelloUser extends PureComponent {
  render() {
    return (
      <p> Hello, {this.props.name} </p>
      <p> You are visitor number {this.props.visitor} to this site </p>
    );
  }
}
// Guarantee that our component's props will include defined values for name and number
HelloUser.defaultProps = {
  name: "User",
  number: 1
}

```

### State <a id="state"></a>

Props are fine for configuring components with initial values, but if we want to update a property of the object over time, or in response to something, we need to use the component's **state**.

To create a **stateful** component \(as opposed to a **stateless** component\), we need three things:

* A `constructor` method
* A `super` method
* A `this.state` property

#### _Constructor method_ <a id="constructor-method"></a>

The `constructor` method is called automatically whenever a component is created - it's similar to Ruby classes' `initialize` method.

#### _Super method_ <a id="super-method"></a>

The `super` method should sit inside the `constructor` method. This gives the component all the functionality of the `constructor` method of the class it inherited from - in this case, the `React.Component` class.

#### _this.state_ <a id="this-state"></a>

Be default, a component's `state` property is undefined. Using the constructor method, we can set `this.state` to be a value - for example, an object with a `text` key, the value of which might change in response to user input.

```javascript
class MyComponent extends PureComponent {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      text: ""
    }
  }
  //etc etc
}
```

### Lifecycle <a id="lifecycle"></a>

A stateful React component has three main parts to its lifecycle:

* **Mounting** - The component is being inserted into the DOM
* **Updating** - The component is being re-rendered in the virtual DOM to determine whether the DOM needs updating
* **Unmounting** - The component is being removed from the DOM

React gives us a number of **lifecycle methods** that allow us to hook into the various parts of the lifecycle.

#### _Mounting_ <a id="mounting"></a>

* `getInitialState()`: object is invoked before a component is mounted. Stateful components should implement this and return the initial state data.
* `componentWillMount()` is invoked immediately before mounting occurs. This is a good point to do things that might take a bit of time, such as AJAX requests.
* `componentDidMount()` is invoked immediately after mounting occurs - ie, the element is on the page. Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here.

#### _Updating_ <a id="updating"></a>

* `componentWillReceiveProps(object nextProps)` is invoked when a mounted component receives new props - the properties have been updated, and the component is about to receive them. This method should be used to compare `this.props` and `nextProps` to perform state transitions using this.setState\(\).
* `shouldComponentUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState): boolean` is invoked when a component decides whether any changes warrant an update to the DOM. Implement this as an optimization to compare `this.props` with `nextProps` and `this.state` with `nextState` and `return false` if React should skip updating.
* `componentWillUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState)` is invoked immediately before updating occurs - React is about to start updating the page with new component markup. You cannot call `this.setState()` here.
* `componentDidUpdate(object prevProps, object prevState)` is invoked immediately after updating occurs - React has made changes to the DOM.

#### _Unmounting_ <a id="unmounting"></a>

* `componentWillUnmount()` is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. This is where you should do your cleanup - turn off timers, stop animations, etc.

### Exemplar component <a id="exemplar-component"></a>

Without filling out the methods themselves, this is what a stateful component with propType validation, prop defaults and lifecycle hooks might look like:

```javascript
class HelloUser extends PureComponent {
​
// CONSTRUCTOR METHOD
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      text: ""
    }
  }
​
// LIFECYCLE HOOKS
  // - Mounting
  getInitialState() { }
  componentWillMount() { }
  componentDidMount() { }
  // - Updating
  componentWillReceiveProps(object nextProps) { }
  shouldComponentUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState): boolean { }
  componentWillUpdate(object nextProps, object nextState) { }
  componentDidUpdate(object prevProps, object prevState) { }
  // - Unmounting
  componentWillUnmount() { }
​
// RENDER METHOD
  render() {
    return (
      <p> Hello, {this.props.name} </p>
      <p> You are visitor number {this.props.visitor} to this site </p>
    );
  }
}
​
// PROPTYPE VALIDATION
HelloUser.propTypes = {
  name: React.PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  visitor: React.PropTypes.number
};
​
// PROP DEFAULTS
HelloUser.defaultProps = {
  name: "User",
  number: 1
}
​
// INVOCATION
ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloUser name="Badger" visitor=1138 />,
  document.getElementById("app")
);
```

### _ReactJS - Components - Further Reading_ <a id="reactjs-components-further-reading"></a>

* ​[ReactJS - Documentation - Reusable Components](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#prop-validation)​
* ​[Ricosta Cruz - ReactJS Cheatsheet](http://ricostacruz.com/cheatsheets/react.html)​

## Class Demos <a id="class-demos"></a>

* ​React Intro​
* React Calculator​
* ​React Clickr​

Navigate to you directory where you want to store your application and use Create React App to generate a new application for you.

`create-react-app intro`

Navigate into the new folder

`cd intro`

Start the server `npm run start` or just `npm start` this will automatically open your browser and run localhost:3000

Open the application in ATOM

`atom .`

Create a new file in `src` folder called `Helloworld.js` and add the below code.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
​
// extend is like inheritance
class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  // must always have the render function
  // using ES6 same as const render = function(){}
  render(){
    // using JSX so we don't need this to be in a string.
    return (<h1>Hello World!</h1>);
  }
}
```

Now we need to display this new component Go to `App.js` and change the render to look like this

```javascript
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <HelloWorld />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

We still haven't imported the `<HelloWorld />` component so we can't see it yet. Add the import to the top of the `App.js` page.

```javascript
import HelloWorld from './HelloWorld';
```

We wont be able to see it yet because we haven't exported from the bottom of the `Helloworld.js` file.

```javascript
import React from 'react';
​
class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render(){
    return (<h1>Hello World!!!</h1>);
  }
}
// Export HelloWorld so it can be seen
export default HelloWorld;
```

We can refactor our code to include `PureComponent`. This will stop you from having bad habits.

```javascript
import React, { PureComponent } from 'react';
​
class HelloWorld extends PureComponent {
  render(){
    return (<h1>Hello World!!!</h1>);
  };
}
export default HelloWorld;
```

Create file in the `src` directory called `HelloUser`. Open the file and add the below code.

```javascript
Import React with PureComponent
​
import React, { PureComponent } from 'react'; // destructuring
​
class HelloUser extends PureComponent {
  render(){
    //you can interpolate with {}
    return (<h2>Hello { this.props.name }</h2>)
  }
}
​
export default HelloUser;
```

Open `App.js` and import `HelloUser` You can pass information through to components via `props` by giving the component an argument. Add a `name` with a value to the `HelloUser` component.

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import HelloWorld from './HelloWorld';
import HelloUser from './HelloUser';
​
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <HelloWorld />
        <HelloUser name="Greg"/>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
export default App;
```

Open console in your browser and go to the React tab. To install the `React Developer Tools` in chrome follow this link. [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) You will now see that there is a `Props` window. Navigate to the new component, you will see that we now have a value in the props window of `name: "Greg"`
